 objects and its internal representation in Javascript:
 

* Objects are one of the fundamental building blocks in Javascript and they are used to store collections of
 data in an organized manner. An object is a collection of properties and each property is comprised of a
  key-value pair. The key is used to identify a property and the value is the data stored in that property.

* In Javascript, objects are dynamic, meaning that properties can be added, modified, and removed at runtime.
 This makes objects an ideal data structure for storing collections of data that can change at runtime.

* The internal representation of objects in Javascript is based on the hash table data structure. A hash
 table is a data structure that allows for efficient lookup and insertion of data by mapping keys to
  indices in an array.

* In Javascript, objects are implemented as hash tables where the keys are hashed to indices in an
 internal array. When a new property is added to an object, a hash value is calculated for the key
  and this hash value is used to determine the index in the internal array where the key-value pair will be stored.

* When an object property is accessed, the hash value of the key is calculated and used to determine
 the index in the internal array where the key-value pair is stored. The value associated with the
  key is then returned.

* The hash table implementation of objects in Javascript has several advantages. First, it allows for
 efficient access and insertion of data. Second, it enables objects to be resized dynamically,
  allowing for the storage of an unlimited number of properties. Third, it provides a way to store 
  properties with the same key in a single object, making it possible to store collections of data 
  that have duplicate keys.

* In conclusion, objects are an essential building block in Javascript and their internal representation
 as hash tables provides a powerful and flexible data structure for storing collections of data. Whether
  you're storing simple data like a user's name and email address or complex data like an entire web
   application, objects are the go-to data structure for storing and organizing data in Javascript.
